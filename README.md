Pipe line du kaggle


Unfinishied kaggle dataset for machine learning, containing all (or almost all) the shots that the hall of fammer n°8 then n°24 of the Los Angeles Lakers basket ball team, Kobe "The Black Mamba" Bryant took in his carrer.

A personal project for after MS school that I began just after the titanic datasets.

While working with this dataset was very entertaning, in basket ball you can be under the rim and still miss the shot while being half 
court and even further and make it, so this dataset hardly apply to machine learning because it is simply impossible to have a 100% 
accuracy.
